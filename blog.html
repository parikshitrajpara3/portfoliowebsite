        <h2>Paul Graham's Writing Advice</h2>
        
        <p>
        Writing is thinking, but the converse is not true.<br>
         <br>
        PG’s recent essay mentions the idea on how writing would become obsolete because of tools like ChatGPT.<br>
        <br>
        Because of the AI, the world will be divided into people who can write and those who cannot.<br>
        <br>
        He mentions that writing is an extension of a certain type of thinking.<br>
        <br>
        Writing allows people to remove all the biases and fuzziness, making ideas clearer.<br>
        <br>
        And the world will be filled with people who can think and those who cannot.

        <h2>OpenAI Co-founder’s advice to Machine Learning Beginners</h2>
       
        <p>If you are a beginner, it often seems daunting to know how many skills you need to learn to become an engineer.</p>

        <p>Therefore, to avoid wasting time during a process that is already so complicated, it is better to focus on finding the right resources and best tools in the market before you start your journey.</p>
        
        <p>However, according to Andrej Karpathy, this is awful advice.</p>
        
        <p>He mentions that the focus should be more on doing a huge volume of work rather than finding the ideal course or perfect tool.</p>
        
        <p>This is because once you begin your journey you will start making many errors which are crucial.</p>
        
        <p>All those errors will act as scar tissue that will help you become better at your skill and later help you navigate efficiently.</p>
        
        <p>The focus should be more on the quantity of work rather than quality for beginners.</p>
