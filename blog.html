        <h2>Paul Graham's Writing Advice</h2>
        <p>Date: 2024-09-01</p>
        <p>
        Writing is thinking, but the converse is not true.<br>
         <br>
        PGâ€™s recent essay mentions the idea on how writing would become obsolete because of tools like ChatGPT.<br>
        <br>
        Because of the AI, the world will be divided into people who can write and those who cannot.<br>
        <br>
        He mentions that writing is an extension of a certain type of thinking.<br>
        <br>
        Writing allows people to remove all the biases and fuzziness, making ideas clearer.<br>
        <br>
        And the world will be filled with people who can think and those who cannot.
